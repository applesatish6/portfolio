               <span> Badminton:</span> Badminton is my favourite game. I love to play badminton. Badminton

                is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.

                the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and

                "doubles" (with two players per side).
                Badminton is often played as a casual

                outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a

                rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with

                the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.

                Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net.

                Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been

                called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.

                [1] Badminton takes its name from the home of the Duke of Beaufort, Badminton

                House in Gloucestershire, England where the first game of badminton was

                played.
                I love badminton because it is good exercise and a

                lot of my friends play. I play a lots of competitions with my friend satish.

                My brother Ramu also plays.

                        <span>Swimming  :</span> swimming is my another favourite hobby. I love swimming because i 

learned how to swim when i was about five years old . i have been doing 

swimming from my childhood onwards 
        
Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through fresh or salt water, 

usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved 

through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both. Humans can hold 

their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within 

weeks of birth, as an evolutionary response.

Swimming is consistently among top public recreational activities  and in some 

countries  swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational 

curriculum . As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, 

national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer 

Olympics.

Though i love to swim everyday, it is good for health and we will be fresh 

throughout the day.

                    <span>Reading books:</span>Each of us has our own specific hobbies. My another great hobbie 

is , I love reading books reading is such a wonderfull hobbie though that it 

enablesone to gather a lot of information and awareness of many facts around 

us

Benefits of reading books:
 I remember that i started reading books from my eight class. I used to read 

lot of small story books then i realised and start reading biography of the 

great people in the world, I learnt a lot from that books and i get 

inspiration from them by reading their life styles and how they leave how they 

work and how they dedicate to the work, there are many things i learned from 

those great books.

I have a hectic schedule in a day, but i used to manage read books daily. 

Though all hobbies have their own merits and demerits in their own ways, 

reading is one which has more merits than demerits, I would personally 

recommend that all of who reading this article can read books from right now 

beacuse it is very good habit. Thank you Have a nice day .:)
